# Changelog

All notable changes to the Android Native Root Detection Library will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- iOS detection library port
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Cloud-based threat intelligence integration
- Real-time bypass technique updates

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-06

### Added
- Initial release of the Android Native Root Detection Library
- **Root Detection Capabilities:**
  - Binary detection for common root tools (`su`, `busybox`, etc.)
  - Comprehensive Magisk detection (paths, memory patterns, system properties)
  - Root manager APK detection (SuperSU, KingoUser, etc.)
  - Custom ROM and development build detection
  - Bootloader unlock status verification

- **Framework Detection:**
  - Xposed Framework detection (classic, EdXposed, LSPosed)
  - Zygisk injection pattern detection
  - Memory map scanning for framework signatures
  - Runtime instrumentation detection

- **Security Analysis:**
  - Multi-layered Frida detection (memory patterns, default ports, thread analysis)
  - Android emulator detection (AVD, Genymotion, x86 analysis)
  - USB debugging and developer mode detection
  - Timing-based instrumentation detection

- **Anti-Bypass Features:**
  - Root cloaking application detection
  - Network security analysis (proxy detection, SSL pinning bypass)
  - Comprehensive security threat assessment
  - Execution timing analysis for debug detection

- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - Optimized regex patterns for memory scanning
  - Efficient file system checks
  - Minimal overhead for basic detection methods
  - Background thread compatibility

### Technical Details
- **Supported Architectures:** ARM64, ARM, x86, x86_64
- **Minimum Android API:** Level 21 (Android 5.0)
- **CMake Version:** 3.22.1+
- **NDK Compatibility:** r21+

### Security Features
- **Obfuscated Function Names:** All JNI methods use randomized names
- **Anti-Debugging:** Multiple timing and instrumentation checks
- **Memory Protection:** Process memory scanning capabilities
- **Network Analysis:** Suspicious endpoint detection

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with usage examples
- Complete Android application example
- CMake integration guide
- Performance impact documentation
- Security best practices guide

### Known Limitations
- Memory scanning operations have higher performance impact
- Some detection methods may have false positives on custom ROMs
- Network-based checks require appropriate permissions
- Timing-based detection may vary across different device capabilities

## [0.9.0-beta] - 2025-07-28

### Added
- Initial beta implementation
- Core root detection logic
- Basic Magisk and Xposed detection
- Frida instrumentation detection prototype

### Changed
- Refactored detection algorithms for better performance
- Improved memory scanning efficiency

### Security
- Added obfuscation recommendations
- Implemented basic anti-tampering measures

## Version Numbering

This project uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: New functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- **PATCH**: Backwards compatible bug fixes

## Support Policy

- **Current Version (1.x)**: Full support with security updates and new features
- **Previous Major Versions**: Security updates only for 6 months after new major release
- **Beta Versions**: Limited support, use for testing only

## Upgrade Notes

### From Beta to 1.0.0
- Update JNI method names to new obfuscated versions
- Review performance impact of new comprehensive checks
- Update Gradle configuration for new CMake requirements
- Test network permission requirements for new security checks

## Security Advisories

Security vulnerabilities are reported privately. See the repository security policy for reporting procedures.
